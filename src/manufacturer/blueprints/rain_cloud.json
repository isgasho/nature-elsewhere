// now a rain cloud can become a cloud but not vice-versa by turning on and off the child

// i don't really care if a sprite changes variant after ocnstruction or not and i don't think there's
// a lot of limits on the system from preventing it

// rain clouds are a superset of clouds. why can't they compose in clouds as a component? can i have components of components
// compositions in ECS? for example bo DialogPrompt may want to compose in two Buttons and appear in the settings Level

// how to rep variants
// how does the other guy do it? i need a template factory that makes sense and shows how state trnasitions can work
// this is solveable
// what were my big problems?
// camera system

// how can i take into account the blueprint for states the entity isn't in yet? i don't want to have to preconsturct everything. can i leave it uninitialized?
